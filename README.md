## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js 18+ installed
2. A Firebase project set up

### Firebase Setup

1. **Create a Firebase Project**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or use an existing one
   - Enable Authentication and Firestore Database

2. **Configure Authentication**
   - In Firebase Console, go to Authentication > Sign-in method
   - Enable Email/Password authentication
   - Optionally enable other providers as needed

3. **Set up Firestore Database**
   - Go to Firestore Database
   - Create database in production mode
   - Set up security rules as needed

4. **Get Firebase Configuration**
   - Go to Project Settings > General
   - Scroll down to "Your apps" section
   - Click on the web app icon or create a new web app
   - Copy the Firebase configuration object

### Installation

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Edit `.env` file with your Firebase configuration:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Creating Your First Admin User

After setting up Firebase, you'll need to create an admin user to access the admin dashboard:

```bash
npm run create-admin
```

Follow the prompts to enter:
- Admin email address
- Password (minimum 6 characters)
- Full name

This will create a user with admin role in Firebase Authentication and Firestore.

### User Roles

The application supports two user roles:

- **Admin**: Full system access, user management, analytics
- **Cooperative**: Cooperative-specific dashboard and features

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/    # Static assets
